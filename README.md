## About Black Highlighter

Black Highlighter makes it easy to hide text in images you want to share. Black Highlighter’s “Magic Highlighting” feature automatically detects text in images and helps you make nice, even redactions in your photos and screenshots.

Black Highlighter is available [on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/black-highlighter/id1215283742?ls=1&mt=8&at=11lrHm).

## About the GitHub Repository

If you're seeing this on GitHub, you should know that this version of the repo is **not the canonical source** for this project. It is updated rarely, when I remember to push updates at each release. If you would like to see a more up-to-date version of the code, as well as issues, progress, etc., please view it instead on my [personal GitLab instance](https://git.pado.name/highlighter/app).

## About Black Highlighter

Black Highlighter makes it easy to hide text in images you want to share. Black Highlighter’s “Magic Highlighting” feature automatically detects text in images and helps you make nice, even redactions in your photos and screenshots.

Black Highlighter is available [on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/black-highlighter/id1215283742?ls=1&mt=8&at=11lrHm).

## About the GitHub Repository

Black Highlighter exists on GitHub as a way to share the source of the app and ongoing roadmap publicly. It is **not** intended as a collaborative project. I do not, as a general rule, accept contributions or pull requests.

That said, issues are an exception to that. Feature requests or bug reports can be opened as GitHub Issues. Voting or commenting on existing issues is also highly encouraged; it can help prioritize what to fix or implement. If you'd prefer to report something pseudononymously, or send me test cases that you don't want published publicly, you can instead send me an e-mail at [hello@cocoatype.com](mailto:hello@cocoatype.com).
